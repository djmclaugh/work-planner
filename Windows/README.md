# Windows
Compiled versions of work planner created using pkg (https://github.com/vercel/pkg#readme).

# How to run

Download this whole folder (both the `.exe` and the `.node` need to be in the same folder).

Simply double click the `.exe` and this will open a window and start the web server on port 8080. You can then access the application with your browser of choice by navigating to `http://localhost:8080`. You can stop the server by closing the window.

A database file name `workplanner.db` will be created in the same folder as the `.exe`. This fill will contain all of your user data.

Note: You might prefer running the server in the background without a window polluting your taskbar. You can find different options to do this here: https://superuser.com/questions/43206/how-can-i-hide-an-application-from-the-windows-taskbar
